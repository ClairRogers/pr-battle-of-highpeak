                <p>Eight weeks. That’s how long you’ve been here, sitting and waiting. Four weeks ago the wisps had appeared to help you refine your skills, or just be a listening ear to those who needed it. You weren’t sure if you could trust them initially--but they didn’t seem to be here to cause any harm, so warily you allowed them to stay.</p>
                <p>Then one evening the sun sinks like it had for the past eight weeks. Slow and colorful as it descends behind the mountains on the other side of the endless lake, there is something alluring about tonight’s sunset. You feel yourself drawn to come watch from the terrace, to be in the company of your trialmates as the stars emerge. Everyone else seems to have the same feeling as well. You have a sinking suspicion that you know this means your time in the Gardens is coming to an end.</p>
                <p>As the sun lowers, you watch with bated breath for something to happen. And just as the last light of the sun falls behind the horizon, a beam of green light shoots into the sky. The flash is brilliant and blinding for a moment, and when you are finally able to open your eyes again, a great black winged cat is lowering himself out of the air and onto the smooth marble.</p>
                <p>Oordeel has returned.</p>
                <p><b>“I hope you have all prepared,"</b> Oordeel begins as his wings fold shut, <b>“for the war you are about to witness."</b></p>
                <p>With a sweep of his smoky tail, he walks down the line of your group with a powerful gait, yet carries himself with a grace you can only describe as godly. His sharp yellow eyes study you intently, as if they might pierce through you and discover all your secrets. Finally, he grunts.</p>
                <p><b>“Perhaps our first victory is that none of you have killed each other,"</b> he muses. Evidently, the myriad of scars and scratches haven’t escaped his sight. <b>“It seems you’re all still here. So I’ll need you to tell me how you can make yourselves the most useful."</b></p>
                <p>He stretches his wings and flaps to a higher pedestal to look at everybody at once.</p>
                <p><b>“I’m taking you all to Highpeak,"</b> Oordeel announces. At this proclamation, a wave of hushed murmuring ripples through the crowd. Oordeel presses on. <b>“I have spent the last few weeks trying to get as close as I could without being noticed. Kaulu and Helena are hiding at the top of the mountain, and they are destroying our world. Helena's open strings are leeching the life straight out of the Valley; the entire place is a deadzone. It's creating her new world. I need to get to the top of Highpeak and stop her, but her magic is keeping me from transporting us all directly there."</b></p>
                <p><b>“I need each of you to tell me what role you can play,"</b> he continues. <b>“The mountain is crawling with monsters and Plagued cats. If you can fight well and serve as an effective distraction, speak up."</b></p>
                <p>He pauses to wait for the response. <b>“If you’re interested in rescuing the cats that have been trapped inside the mountain, speak up. Some of you may know them...most of them are simple mortals, but I believe you call some of them the Legendaries. Kaulu has separated them from their soul partners and weakened their power… we need rescue teams to reunite them."</b></p>
                <p>Oordeel waits again for volunteers, uninterested in the emotional reaction his words stir in some of the trial cats.</p>
                <p><b>“And if you have a talent for stealth, I need you to climb to the top of Highpeak. You need to make sure I can get to Helena unseen, or else this is all for nothing. Speak up."</b> He pauses again as volunteers raise their voices.</p>
                <p><b>“Are we all clear? Good.</b></p>
                <p><b>“It’s time to end this."</b></p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="story2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-2">
                <p>Anticipation is thick in the air after Oordeel’s announcement. Some of it nervous, some of it excited and determined… all of it filled with purpose. Gradually, as the crowd mingles, decides their positions, and exchanges their “good luck"s and “be careful"s, three large groups slowly form: the cats who want to battle, those who want to climb the mountain, and those who want to help those trapped within it.</p> 
                <p><b>“Very good,"</b> Oordeel says, his voice practically a purr. His orange gaze is hard, but satisfied. <b>“My sister and that <i>dog</i> think they have your world in their grasp. But they are wrong."</b> He spreads his wings wide, sweeping his gaze over everyone gathered below. <b>“This is their reckoning. <i>This</i> is a legion to contend with."</b></p>
                <p>He turns away from you for a moment, his eyes lifting towards the sky and the stars that are slowly starting to appear in the inky abyss. An emotion you can’t quite place swims in his gaze and you can’t help but wonder… after all he’s seen, where do his thoughts take him now?</p>
                <p>He turns back to you, squaring his shoulders. The fading light catches in his eyes and the gold of his collar. A rare, grim smile crosses his face. </p>
                <p><b>“To war,"</b> he declares.</p>
                <p>And then black smoke sweeps through your ranks, cloaking you in darkness, and you leave everything you know behind. </p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p><i>Meanwhile, in the Valley...</i></p>
                <p>The attack came with little warning. The cries of alarm started from the Red Plague quarantine quarters, but spread rapidly throughout the tunnels.The scarlet eyes of those you had been seeking to heal gleamed in the dark tunnels back at you, malicious and violent. Something had changed. The Plagued cats turned their claws on you.</p>
                <p>You wanted to fight back. At first, you did. But these were the faces of your loved ones. This was the blood of your friends. You could not bring yourself to kill them, and the Legendaries commanded you not to. You were overpowered, exhausted, nearly starved--and the force of the Plague cats was overwhelming. But the sick did not kill you, not unless you fought back. They rounded you up and led you into the deep.</p>
                <p>You are no longer refugees. You are all prisoners.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="story3" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-3">
                <p>When your paws find solid ground again, you are almost relieved to see the drab gray landscape of Highpeak. The red line at the top rises high, disappearing into the low, rumbling cloud cover. You can see a more direct path to the top now. The universe has spit you out nearly at Helena’s front steps.</p>
                <p>You look around then and are caught by surprise; the cats surrounding you are not the cats you had grown accustomed to being around. A new group of cats are here--new teammates.</p>
                <p>While you hope your old teammates are safe, you wonder why this particular shift through space has shuffled you and your friends around. You wonder what is in store for you next...</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="story4" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-4">
                <p>As you and your trialmates reach the top of the mountain, the ground underfoot begins to dry. Mud no longer squelches between your toes, replaced instead by gravel and stone. You are exhausted, and the ominous hum of the red line getting closer and closer seems to be the cause. You can feel every cell in your body almost drawing towards it like a magnet, your muscles and flesh straining. It is slowly wearing you down.</p>
                <p>The trail grows foggy-- though you realize quickly that it isn’t fog. It’s clouds. The damp cold clings to your pelt and restricts your vision, but you must go onward.</p>
                <p>Finally, you reach the top of the trail, and you come to a plateau in the incline. The path opens up into a wide clearing with mountain rock shielding the edges. You can see other teams arriving at the same time as you from different paths; it looks like almost everyone has made it, with varying states of being. On the far side of the clearing, the wall of rock is the highest, soaring up into the hazy sky, and you can see something that looks like a door etched into the stone, the shape of a cat’s head in the center.</p>
                <p>Sitting on either side of the carving are two gods; Helena and Kaulu.</p>
                <p>Kaulu’s tail wags in delight. <b>“Oh, goodie! You made it! Did you have fun?"</b></p>
                <p>Helena’s fur bristles, her great white wings already opening. <b>“<i>You?!</i> I thought I <i>drowned</i> you!"</b></p>
                <p>Helena surges forward with insane speed, the light of her renewed god powers blinding you for a second, but about halfway across the clearing a mass of black smoke rises from the ground and clashes with her. The goddess leaps backwards and lands on her four paws, flapping her wings to disperse the black clouds.</p>
                <p>Oordeel hovers in the air in front of her, the dark smoke around him dissipating with the wind his wings create. <b>"You should have drowned <i>me.</i>"</b> </p>
                <p>Helena spits at the ground, looking furious for a second. But then her eyes light up. Kaulu looks enthralled, like this is no more than good entertainment to him. Helena straightens up with a smug expression. <b>"Brother, it makes sense I’d see you here. After all, I did take your toys."</b></p>
                <p>With a swoop of a wing, the clouds surrounding the clearing part. You aren’t sure what she’s talking about right away until you see the bodies of cats hovering high in the air around you. There is a single red vertical line resting on each of them, the red expanding around their bodies like a net. You look at them in horror; are they <i>dead?</i> But their eyes are open, and they look more like they’re trapped than lifeless. You look closer-- you <i>recognize</i> them. Sunder, Nor, Lazarus, Zilla...all of them. They’re all here, save for the few you had rescued. Legendaries.</p>
                <p><b>"No,"</b> Oordeel says breathlessly as it dawns on him who they are. He swivels around to snarl at his sister. <b>"What are you doing to them?"</b></p>
                <p><b>"Nor!"</b> you hear someone call out. Jace. She scrambles ahead, shadows drawing up to her side. <b>"No, <i>Millie!</i>"</b> The Legendary sends shards of shadows upwards around her friends, but they whizz through the air and dissipate quickly. Her power is being sapped just like yours.</p>
                <p><b>"Oh!"</b> Helena chirps, looking at Jace, then the other Legendaries you had brought with. <b>"You brought more! Ah, what’s her name? Serpent!"</b> </p>
                <p>Before she even finishes the word, eleven massive serpents the support teams instantly recognize slither out from the crags and nooks of the mountain. One slams Jace down, its whiskers immediately touching her temples. Jace fights back, but you can see the sleep-inducing powers of the serpent already taking hold. The other ten lunge for the rest of the Legendaries, targeting each of them specifically, herding them onto the edge of the clearing.</p>
                <p>It had all happened so fast. Oordeel bellows, <b>"I’m killing you, once and for all!"</b> and flings himself at his smiling sister. The two clash, ripping at each other’s pelts, flashes of green and gold colliding and exploding.</p>
                <p>You are about to leap into action when a cry from the back of your group sounds out; the Plagued have caught up to you. They attack ferociously, seeming to target the unawakened souls of the group, flooding the clearing from all sides. You must do what you can to protect the refugees-- hopefully without killing the Plagued.</p>
                <p>Helena lets out a great snarl as she shoves Oordeel backwards and he tumbles, straight into a hoard of the plagued. They leap at him, and at first he begins to use his power, but hesitates and instead starts to use his wings and blasts of black smoke to ward them off. He, too, is trying to spare their lives.</p>
                <p>Helena looks at Oordeel’s struggle with satisfaction at first, but as it continues you can see her expression turning sour. She can’t seem to look at him as he’s overwhelmed by wave after wave of the Plagued, his growls and cries of frustration growing louder.</p>
                <p><b>"Don’t be growing soft now, Helena!"</b> Kaulu laughs from his spot on the other side. <b>"This is what you wanted. Destruction and death to all memory and existence of this world. This is what you did <i>all</i> of this for!"</b> He leans forward, his grin widening into a devilish expression full of teeth too wicked. <b>"Don’t you want to watch this moment? Don’t you want to remember it?"</b></p>
                <p>Helena stares at him, her expression unreadable. Then she turns, and watches Oordeel.</p>
                <p>You had been so close to victory. Chaos surrounds you. Failure is not an option anymore. You must do what you can.</p>

                  <h3>Character Roles</h3>
                  <p>Each role will focus mainly on a certain aspect of gameplay--combat, puzzles, or story. This doesn’t mean that it will be the only element you experience, however; combat-focused players should also get a little bit of puzzles and story, puzzle-focused players will still get story elements and battle, and story-focused players will still get battles and puzzles. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Battle</b> teams will be the main teams fighting monsters and plagued cats. Players will be using DnD-type battle mechanics, rolling for attacks and damage, and maybe having some small challenge mechanics as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Stealth</b> teams are mainly focused on sneaking to the top of Highpeak, and finding ways around Helena’s defenses. This role is focused on puzzles, riddles, and problem-solving.</li>
                    <li><b>Support</b> teams will mainly be search-and-rescue parties for the NPCs and Legendaries trapped in the Valley. This role is focused more heavily on writing and story.</li>

You also do not have to wait for a mod to react to your actions; you can write your fights with the Plagued as if you have full control over the story. Please do not control the gods or make any decisions for them! (for example ‘My character killed all the Plagued cats around Oordeel and he is now free!’ would not be allowed).</p>

            <!-- <ul>
              <li>Like every other Trial, to be considered active and save your character from dying at the end, everyone is required to make 5 posts. Please put your post number somewhere on every post, to make it easy for us to keep track.</li>
              <li>In your posting format, please make sure to include: post number, link to character app, link to skill sheet, post summary, and current HP (out of 20).</li>
              <li>Only roleplay in your assigned Google Doc with your assigned teammates.</li>
              <li>Checkpoints will be given no less frequently than every other day, but sometimes will come more often than that.</li>
              <li>Try to check your current doc at least once a day if you can to stay updated, but you don’t have to post every time!</li>
              <li>Try your best to communicate with your quest teammates if you are going to be inactive for a long period of time! Alert the mods as well.</li>
              <li>Like last time, this Trial has a specific timeline and we are trying to keep it fairly fast-paced and therefore checkpoints will not wait for players who are inactive. Please be accommodating to a teammate who has missed and needs help catching up if they need it! The mods will do their best as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Guest Rules</h3>
              <p>Guests, both Legendaries and otherwise, must follow the same rules as players with a couple exceptions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We encourage a 3-post requirement for guests this trial, however this will not be strictly enforced.</li>
                <li>Posting format for guests only needs to include: link to character app, post summary, and HP.</li>
                <li>While normal players have 20 HP, guests have 15 HP and Legendaries have 25 HP.</li>
              </ul> -->
              <p>All rules of roleplay etiquette remain the same during the finale! But since we are having the entirety of the group roleplaying in the same place, we have a few extra guidelines for you to follow.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Please try to keep your posts short and concise. Some prose is fine, but with the volume of people posting it will make everything much easier to digest if posts are kept short!</li>
                <li>Try to allow 3-5 posts between your own.</li>
                <li>Please put any actions involving the gods or item usage in an ACTION summary at the bottom of your post. We may miss it if you don’t!</li> 
              </ul>
              <h3>The Plagued</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>You may claim ANY NUMBER of Plagued NPCs during the finale! Nearly all of the Plagued cats are here, and if you want to face off against your own NPCs you are more than welcome to do so.</li>
                <li>There is no official format for this, you can just include the NPCs in your reaction posts.</li>
                <li>Remember that we are still trying to not kill the Plagued in-character! If your cat does want to kill the Plagued, though, you can do so as long it is not someone else’s NPC (or if you have permission), or if it is an unclaimed/unknown Plagued cat.</li>
